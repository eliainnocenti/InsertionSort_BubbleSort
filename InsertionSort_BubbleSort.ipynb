    "### Introduction to Sorting Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that solve the following sorting problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input**: A sequence of $n$ numbers $<a_1, a_2, ..., a_n>$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**: A permutation (reordering) $<a_1', a_2', ..., a_n'>$ of the input sequence such that $a_1' \\leq a_2' \\leq ... \\leq a_n'$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many sorting algorithms, each with its own advantages and limitations, based on time complexity, space complexity, stability and the type of data to be sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will focus on two simple sorting algorithms: **Insertion Sort** and **Bubble Sort**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insertion Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insertion Sort** is a simple sorting algorithm that works by building a sorted portion of the list one element at a time. Its main idea is to take each element from the unsorted part of the list and insert it into its correct position within the sorted portion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a brief overview of how Insertion Sort works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: The algorithm starts with the first element, assuming it's already sorted.\n",
    "2. **Comparison and Insertion**: It then iterates through the unsorted portion of the list, comparing each element with the elements in the sorted portion. It finds the correct position for the current element within the sorted part and inserts it there.\n",
    "3. **Expansion**: This process continues iteratively, with the sorted portion growing by one element in each iteration.\n",
    "4. **Termination**: The algorithm terminates when the sorted portion of the list reaches the end of the list.\n"

    "The time complexity of Insertion Sort is typically analyzed based on the number of comparisons and swaps it makes as it sorts an array of $n$ elements. Here's a breakdown of the complexity analysis:\n",

    "- Best-case time complexity: when the input array is already sorted. In this case, Insertion Sort makes only $n - 1$ comparisons and $0$ swaps. Therefore, the best-case time complexity is $O(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Average-case time complexity: when the input array is a random permutation of elements. In this case, Insertion Sort makes approximately $n^2/4$ comparisons and $n^2/4$ swaps. Therefore, the average-case time complexity is $O(n^2)$.\n",

    "### Bubble Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bubble Sort** is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. It is called Bubble Sort because with each iteration, the largest element in the unsorted portion of the list bubbles up towards its correct position in the sorted portion of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a brief overview of how Bubble Sort works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: The algorithm starts with the first element.\n",
    "2. **Comparison and Swapping**: The algorithm iterates through the list and compares each pair of adjacent items. If the items are in the wrong order (e.g. the current element is greater than the next element), it swaps them.\n",
    "3. **Expansion**: This process continues iteratively. The largest element \"bubbles up\" to the end of the list, so the sorted portion of the list actually grows from the end of the list toward the beginning. \n",
    "4. **Termination**: The algorithm terminates when there are no more swaps and it successfully goes through the entire list without making any changes."
