    "### Introduction to Sorting Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that solve the following sorting problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input**: A sequence of n numbers $<a_1, a_2, ..., a_n>$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**: A permutation (reordering) $<a_1', a_2', ..., a_n'>$ of the input sequence such that $a_1' \\leq a_2' \\leq ... \\leq a_n'$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many sorting algorithms, each with its own advantages and limitations, based on time complexity, space complexity, stability and the type of data to be sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will focus on two simple sorting algorithms: **Insertion Sort** and **Bubble Sort**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insertion Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insertion Sort** is a simple sorting algorithm that works by building a sorted portion of the list one element at a time. Its main idea is to take each element from the unsorted part of the list and insert it into its correct position within the sorted portion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a brief overview of how Insertion Sort works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: The algorithm starts with the first element, assuming it's already sorted.\n",
    "2. **Comparison and Insertion**: It then iterates through the unsorted portion of the list, comparing each element with the elements in the sorted portion. It finds the correct position for the current element within the sorted part and inserts it there.\n",
    "3. **Expansion**: This process continues iteratively, with the sorted portion growing by one element in each iteration.\n"

    "The time complexity of Insertion Sort is typically analyzed based on the number of comparisons and swaps it makes as it sorts an array of n elements. Here's a breakdown of the complexity analysis:\n",
    "- Best-case time complexity: when the input array is already sorted. In this case, Insertion Sort makes only n - 1 comparisons and 0 swaps. Therefore, the best-case time complexity is O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Average-case time complexity: when the input array is a random permutation of elements. In this case, Insertion Sort makes approximately n^2^/4 comparisons and (n^2)/4 swaps. Therefore, the average-case time complexity is O(n^2).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Worst-case time complexity: when the input array is in reverse order, and each element needs to be compared and swapped with all the previous elements in the sorted portion of the array. In this case, Insertion Sort makes approximately (n^2)/2 comparisons and n(^2)/2 swaps. Therefore, the worst-case time complexity is O(n^2).\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity of Insertion Sort is O(1), meaning it sorts the array in-place without requiring additional memory allocation proportional to the input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Insertion Sort has a best-case time complexity of O(n), but its average-case and worst-case time complexity are both O(n^2). It is not considered efficient for large datasets, but it can be adaptive and perform well on nearly sorted data or small datasets. "
